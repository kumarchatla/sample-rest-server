# Sample Rest Server

This Java project contains a basic rest server example (based on the [Spark micro framework](http://sparkjava.com/)) that I am using to run some CI/CD testing with [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io), the [CloudBees Jenkins Distribution](https://www.cloudbees.com/products/cloudbees-jenkins-distribution) and [CloudBees Core](https://www.cloudbees.com/products/cloudbees-core).
